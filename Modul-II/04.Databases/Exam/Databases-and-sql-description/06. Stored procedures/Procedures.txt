1. Returning all computers (vendor, model, id) with memory (RAM) between provided range
go
CREATE PROCEDURE usp_GetComputersWithRamBetween @MinRam int, @MaxRam int
AS

	Select Vendor, Model, Id
	FROM Computers
	WHERE RAM between @MinRam and @MaxRam

GO

exec usp_GetComputersWithRamBetween 1,8

--------

2. Returning all computers with a specific GPU (by id) and range of memory (as the above)

CREATE PROCEDURE usp_GetComputersWithGpuAndRamBetween @GpuId int, @MinRam int, @MaxRam int
AS

SELECT c.Id as ComputerID, c.Vendor as ComputerVendor, c.RAM as ComputerRam, g.Model as GPUModel ,g.Vendor as GPUVendor
FROM Computers c
JOIN ComputersGPUs cgp
	on c.id = cgp.ComputerId
JOIN GPUs g
	on g.Id = cgp.GPUId
WHERE GPUId = @GpuId AND RAM between @MinRam and @MaxRam

exec usp_GetComputersWithGpuAndRamBetween 2,8,16


3.  Return all GPUs that can be paired with a concrete computer type (dekstop, ultrabook or notebook)

CREATE PROCEDURE 
usp_GetGpusForComputerType @ComputerType nvarchar(50)
AS
SELECT g.Vendor as GPUVendor, g.Model as GPUModel
FROM Computers c
JOIN ComputersGpus cg
	ON c.id = cg.ComputerId
JOIN GPUs g
	On g.Id = cg.GPUId
JOIN ComputerTypes ct
	on ct.Id = c.Id
WHERE ct.TypeName = @ComputerType

exec usp_GetGpusForComputerType 'Ultrabook'
exec usp_GetGpusForComputerType 'Desktop'
exec usp_GetGpusForComputerType 'Notebook'
