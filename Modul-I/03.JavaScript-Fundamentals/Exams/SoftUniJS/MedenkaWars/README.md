# Problem 1 – Medenka Wars

In a galaxy far-far away… The Dark Medenka Side and The Light Medenka Side are in a ruthless war. Their leaders The Dark Medenka Lord Naskor and The White Medenka Lord Vitkor are fighting mercilessly, and the medenkas are their only weapons.

You will be receiving several lines containing medenka data in the following formats – &quot;2 white medenkas&quot;, &quot;1 dark medenkas&quot;... The **amount** of medenkas, specify the **damage** every lord deals to the other. Because Naskor and Vitkor are both great lords, they are immortal, so the winner will be decided by the **most**** damage dealt**.

**1 medenka = 60 damage.**

If the input is &quot; **white** medenkas&quot;, Vitkor attacks, if it&#39;s &quot; **dark** medenkas&quot;, Naskor attacks. The great lords also have special abilities. If Naskor makes **5**** consecutive normal **attacks with the** same damage **, the 5-th attack&#39;s damage will be** multiplied **by** 4.5 **. This counts as a** normal **attack. If Vitkor makes** 2 ****consecutive**** normal **attacks with the** same damage **, the** second **attack becomes** special **and deals** x2.75 damage**.

When you receive all the input you must find the winner. The winner is determined by the **most damage dealt**. It is safe to assume, that there will be no stalemates.
